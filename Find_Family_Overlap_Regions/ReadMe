Find_Family_Overlap_Regions

Determines which regions of a set of child genomes have been inherited in common.
Takes in to account mode of inheritance and whether the children share (afffected) or don't share (unaffected).

input from child comparison state files from Family_Inheritqnce_State_Analysis.pl
eg *_Ch1_Ch2_Pat_States_GT_5.tsv
Each child must be entered as affected or unaffected
Regions shared by affected siblings but not shared by unaffected siblings will be outputted
user can select whether to output a header.
Header structure is the same as for CompleteGenomics headers.

The mode of inheritance determines which files are used.
Files which do not match mode of inheritance are ignored.
So eg a set of files can be inputted and the mode of inheritance varied.

Format:
perl Family_Overlap_Region_Finder \
--Input_Mat input_mat_state_file \ [multiple allowed]
--Input_Pat input_mat_state_file \ [multiple allowed]
--output_dir output_dir \
--Header [optional]
--Affected nr [nr] \ [optional but one of Affected and Unaffected must be present]
--Unaffected nr [nr] \ [optional as above]
--Inheritance_Mode [maternal_dominant|paternal_dominant|recessive]
eg
perl /hoard/home/rtearle/perl/Family_Overlap_Region_Finder_0_1_4.pl \
--Input_Mat /Comparisons/Quartet_testvariants-chr20-22_4_Ch1_Ch2_Mat_States_GT_5.tsv \
