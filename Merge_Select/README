Merge 2 files based on matching fields
User can:
1. select to keep matched, unmatched or all records of file A
2. choose whether to output only 1 copy of fields present in both files (ie remove duplicate fields)
3. choose which fields of either or both files to output, by field name

Syntax:
perl Merge_Select \
--Input_FileA input_file_1 \
--Input_FileB input_file_2 \
--Output_File file \
--Select all|matched|unmatched
--Match fieldname_in_fileA:fieldname_in_FileB [repeated]
--Remove_Dup_Fields [param can be present or absent]
--Output_Fields A.*,B.* [or eg A.fieldname1,A.fieldname2,B.fieldname1 etc]

eg
perl /Perl_Scripts/Merge_Select_0_0_1.pl \
 --Input_FileA /CEPH_Family_3Gen_Dominant_1/CEPH_Family-MGM_F_S1-Het_Het_Het-Coding-Protein_Affecting.tsv \
 --Input_FileB  /CG_Public_Genomes/Public_Genomes_Unrelated_50-testvariants.tsv_Freq_Short.tsv.bz2 \
 --Output_File /Users/rtearle/CEPH_Family-MGM_F_S1-Het_Het_Het-Coding-Protein_Affecting-54Freq_No.tsv \
 --Select all
 --Match chromosome:chromosome
 --Match begin:begin
 --Match end:end
 --Match varType:varType \
 --Match alleleSeq:alleleSeq \
 --Remove_Dup_Fields
 --Output_Fields A.*,B.*
 
The above example takes as first input a file containing variants that are heterozygous in 3 genomes from 3 generations of a family.
The second input is a list of all variants present in 50 unrelated, (non-family) genomes publicly released by CG, along with their frequencies.
The variants in the two files are matched on chromosome, co-ordinates, variant type and variant sequence.
All of the variants of the first file are outputted regardless of whether there is a match [--Select all].
Duplicate fields are removed from the output [--Remove_Dup_Fields].
All of the fields of the first file, along with all the (non-duplicate) fields of the second file, are outputted [--Output_Fields A.*,B.*].
This output file can then be filtered based on the frequency of the family variants in the 50 genome dataset, to identify rare variants.
[Alternatively, if the user wanted variants not present in the 50 genomes, they could set the Select flag to unmatched.]
