This script will combine summary-* files from any number of genomes and create a variety of plots across all metrics.

Instructions: load source and enter top directory or a sample.list (see below) containing ALL CGI directories to be scanned for summary files

The sample.list (optional) is a space delinated file that must have the column heading "dir" like and "DNA", all other columns are optional:
#proj     DNA    cust                 ver      GB  PB   dir
#XXXX   Sample1  XXXX                 1.11     37  a    /path/to/genome/root4sample1
#XXXX   Sample2  XXXX                 1.11     37  a    /path/to/genome/root4sample2

Example run:
#within R
source("graphSummaryData.R")
graph.summary.data(sample.list="mysamples.txt")
#this will graph all summary files with genomes in mysamples.txt assuming assembly version 1.12 and skipping the pairwise regression graphs
#or
graph.summary.data(top_dir="/path/to/root/directory/of/genomes", assembly.version=1.11, test.pairwise=T)
this will graph all summary files with genomes in the directory "/path/to/root/directory/of/genomes" assuming assembly version 1.11 and running the pairwise regression.
