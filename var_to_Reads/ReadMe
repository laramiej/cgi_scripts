var_to_Reads
Takes a nominated chr & range, extracts related information from assembly files
Assembles reads from evidence files if they exist

Format:
perl prog dir dir chr range file
ie
perl var_to_Reads.pl \
 --Input_Dir assembly_dir \
 --Output_Dir dir_path \
 --Chromosome chr \
 --Range n1-n2 \
 --Reference ref.crr
eg
perl /rnd/home/rtearle/perl/var_to_Reads_1_6_3.pl \
 --Input_Dir /GS19240-1100-37-ASM/GS00028-DNA_C01 \
 --Output_Dir /rtearle/data/ \
 --Chromosome chr1 \
 --Range 104206533-104206534 \
 --Reference /ref/build37.crr

Note that the range separator can be anything as long as it is not a number or a tab
But it must be of the form integer separator integer (with no spaces)

The range can encompass more than one interval, with the intervals aligned and printed separately
Includes a base count for each base per position, for each allele

Flow:
Starts with chr and pos
Reports entries for this chr and surrounding posns from CoverageRefScore file
Reports entries for this chr and pos from var, masterVar and gene files
Reports evInt entry covering this chr and pos from evInt file
Reports evidence read entries from evDNB file
Aligns the evidence reads, providing untabbed and tabbed output
Counts and reports the bases for each pos for each allele
