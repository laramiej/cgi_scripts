A Very Simple CNV Variants to wig Converter and BED file generator

Author: Jason M Laramie

cnv2wiggle.pl will create a bed track for ploidy segments different from 2 and a 
wiggle plot of the relative coverage.  These files can be opened in IGV.  This 
script doesn't include hypervariable regions.


#This script uses the cnvDetailsBeta file to create a wiggle track and the 
#cnvSegments file to create a BED track.

How to run: see perldoc cnv2wiggle.pl
