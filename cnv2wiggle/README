cnv2wiggle.pl  will create a bed track for ploidy segments different from 2 and a wiggle plot of the relative coverage.  These files can be opened in IGV.  This script doesn't include hypervariable regions.

# A Very Simple CNV Variants to wig Converter and BED file generator

#This script uses the cnvDetailsBeta file to create a wiggle track and the cnvSegments file to create a BED track.

How to run:
perl cnv2wiggle.pl cnvDetailsBeta-*-ASM cnvSegmentsBeta-*-ASM chromosome sampleId
     where cnvDetailsBeta-*-ASM is the CNVdetails file from CG
     	   and cnvSegmentsBeta-*-ASM is the cnvSegments file from CG
	   chromosome can be a specific chromosome name (e.g. chr1 or chrX) or the word 'all' to process all chromosomes
	   sampleId is the name the created tracks will be given
