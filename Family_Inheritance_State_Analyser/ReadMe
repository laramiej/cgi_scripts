Family_Inheritqnce_State_Analyser
From parental genotype data, detemine which genotypes can be assigned unambiguously (usually aa/ab)
[Not analysing haploids at the moment]
For these aa/ab parental genotypes, look at child inheritance patterns
From aa/ab, children can be aa or ab ie can be the same or different to each other
This pattern should be stable in blocks, which will reflect recombination events
This block information can be used to look for variants which are the same or different in the children

Looking at parental genotyes:
aa/bb and aa/aa are uninformative
The following are MIEs:
aa/aa giving ab or bb in a child is MIE unexpected allele
aa/bb for aa or bb, in a child as MIE impossible combination
aa/ab for bb, in a child as MIE impossible combination
aa/ab potentially informative for state inheritance

input is a testvariants results file

Flow
1. Take output of listvariants/testvariants
2. For all loci, check whether the childrens' genotypes can arise from the parents' genotypes
3. Remove those loci which are discordant ie MIEs
4. Mark loci where one parent is aa (or a) and other is ab (or b) ie potentially informative
5. For these loci, are the children are identical (S) or not (D) for the informative allele
4. Mark loci where one both parents are ab ie potentially informative
6. For these loci are the children identical (S) for the informative allele
7. Save informative aa/ab and ab/ab loci
8. Concatenate blocks of loci with the same state
9. Remove singleton loci and concatenate state blocks again
10. Mark blocks of short runs (user defined) as having an uncertain state (U)
11. Mark gaps between states (G)

To Do: extend to start and end of chromosomes (ie begin and end of called chrs)
